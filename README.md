Memo: Project Description

The project I'm currently working on is a web application that focuses on user management and article/task management. The application provides a login and signup page, allowing users to create an account or log in to their existing account.

Once logged in, users have the ability to add and post articles or tasks. These articles/tasks can be customized with various details such as title, description, and additional content. Users can manage and update their articles/tasks as needed.

One of the key features of the application is the user profile page, where users can view their profile information and make changes if necessary. This provides a personalized experience and allows users to showcase their information to others.

Additionally, the project includes a password reset functionality to ensure account security. If users forget their password, they can initiate a password reset process and regain access to their account.

This project is an ongoing endeavor, with more features planned for the future. The goal is to enhance the user experience and expand the functionality to meet the evolving needs of the users. By providing a seamless login and signup process, article/task management capabilities, user profiles, and password reset functionality, the application aims to offer a comprehensive platform for users to engage and interact effectively.
